# Product Context — Velocity

## What is Velocity?
Velocity is an AI-powered product management assistant for startup PMs. It connects to existing tools (Linear, Slack, Notion) and helps PMs make better product decisions by pulling together external signals and internal state.

## Key Use Cases
1. **Sprint Prioritization** — Analyze backlog, team discussions, and customer feedback to recommend sprint priorities with evidence
2. **Research Synthesis** — Search Slack conversations and web sources to surface relevant context for product decisions
3. **Document Generation** — Create PRDs, stakeholder updates, and decision logs grounded in real data
4. **Backlog Triage** — Review Linear tickets, identify blockers, and suggest action items

## Product Principles
- Every recommendation must cite a source (Slack message, Linear ticket, web result)
- Be concise and actionable — PMs are busy
- Surface what matters, not everything
- Respect the PM's existing workflow — augment, don't replace
